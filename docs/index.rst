Welcome to DTFOWT!
===================================

**DTFOWT** is the digital-twin hub for floating offshore wind applications. Currently, it is a mere combination of edited versions of `ROSCO <https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO>`_ and `OpenFAST <https://github.com/OpenFAST/OpenFAST>`_ and new capabilities such as `WRP <https://github.com/doe-fowt-control/py-wrp>`_ (not implemented yet).

The premise is to build a cloud-based digital-twin that is characterized by four major modules:

**Sensing (nerve)**

**Storing (memory)**

**Learning/Producing (brain)**

**Acting (agency)**

.. note::

   This project is part of a PhD research program designed by `Yuksel (Rudy) Alkarem <https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuksel-rudy/>`_ at the University of Maine and is under active development.
