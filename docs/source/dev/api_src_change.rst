.. _api_& src change:

This page lists the major changes in ROSCO and OpenFAST API and source code between the compiled versions this project uses and OpenFAST version (3.1.0) and ROSCO version (v.2.5.0).

The changes are tabulated according to which category the files are, file name, line number, and the content changed (some example values are given in case of an input file).
The line number corresponds to the resulting line number after all changes are implemented.
Thus, be sure to implement each in order so that subsequent line numbers are correct.
